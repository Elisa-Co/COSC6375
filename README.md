# COSC6375
The purpose of this project is to visualize various aspects in the Air Quality Index between January to August of 2024, using public data made available by the EPA, specifically AQI by County for the 2024 year. This dataset consists of 10 columns that contain information on state and county names/codes, dates, level of concern, AQI, the defining parameter, the defining site, and the number of monitoring sites providing information. The data analysis for this project will focus primarily on the air quality of Texas counties in order to have a narrower scope, so all other states will be disregarded for this project. This will allow for more refinement while showcasing an understanding of Pandas data frames and its use in analyzing data. The goals for this analysis are to determine what counties, if any, had hazardous air quality during the given time period, the top 3 counties that had the most days with “good” air quality, and to create a time series graph showcasing the change in average AQI across the state over the course of the first week of January.
